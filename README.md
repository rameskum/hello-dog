# hello-dog

Being a dog lover just I thought of creating a web application to show random dog images, as part of learning exercise.

This application is build with `javascript`, `css` and `html` only.

## Sample Image

![application-demo](src/res/hello-dog.png)

## API

I'm using the internet's biggest collection of open source dog pictures - **Dog API**
